If you have reached more points than needed in order to level up (i.e. you need 1000 to level up and you have 1100) the points are saved for the next level! Points are not wasted ðŸ˜‰


Billable hours can't cross the maximum count - if you set the Billable hours to 515 and you got 520, it's still 515. Also, the extra hours aren't saved for the next level.
